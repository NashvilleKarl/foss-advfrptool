# fossfrptool

This projects aims to be a free and open soruce FRP removal tool for ANY android device. It will have a cross 
platform GUI (Linux, Windows, OSX), made using wxPython. The app will have a modular, plugin based approach to support 
phones of any make and model, all someone has to do is submit a plugin to enable support for a new device. It will utilize 
background tools such as heimdall, adb, fastboot, etc. Plugins will be coded in python.

Project is still in the dream phaze but I believe that this type of design is what other FRP tools are lacking.
