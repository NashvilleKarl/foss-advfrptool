# foss-advfrptool

This projects aims to be a free and open soruce FRP removal tool for ANY android device. It will have a cross 
platform GUI (Linux, Windows, OSX), made using wxPython. The app will have a module-driven approach to support 
phones of any make and model, as long as someone contributes a module, the phone will be supported. It will utilize 
background tools such as heimdall, adb, fastboot, etc. Modules will have the abliltiy to supply their own background 
tools for usage in the removal process.

We will need to develop processes to enable ADB on major Android brands in order to enable the modules the ability 
to interface with the phones.

Project is still in the dream phaze but I believe this is going to be useful tool and with my design I feel like it 
can be extended as far as the community is willing to push it.
